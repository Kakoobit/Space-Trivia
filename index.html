     <h2 class= "bebas-neue-regular">What is astronomy?</h2>
     <p class="spinnaker-regular"> Astronomy, science that encompasses the study of all extraterrestrial objects and phenomena.  The catalog of objects now studied is much broader and includes, in order of increasing distance, the solar system, the stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy, and other, more distant galaxies. With the advent of scientific space probes, Earth also has come to be studied as one of the planets, though its more-detailed investigation remains the domain of the Earth sciences.</p></nav>
